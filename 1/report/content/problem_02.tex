\section{Problem 1-2 Average Degree of a Growing Network}

Consider the following properties of the network at time $t=T$.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the total number of nodes $N$?
	
	In each time step one node is added to the network. That is why $N=T$
	
	\item What is the total number of links $L$?
	
	For $t=1$ no links exist. For every node also a link is added. That is why $L=T-1$
	
	\item What is the average degree $\langle k \rangle$?
	
	The average degree is defined for an undirected graph as $\langle k \rangle = \frac{2L}{N}$. After inserting the values from above: $\langle k \rangle = \frac{2(T-1)}{T} = \frac{2T-2}{T} = 2 - \frac{2}{T} $
	
	\item What is the average degree in the limit $T \rightarrow \infty$?
	
	When $T \rightarrow \infty$, the second term $\frac{2}{T}$ becomes irrelevant. Consequently the average degree becomes $\langle k \rangle = 2$ for $T \rightarrow \infty$.
