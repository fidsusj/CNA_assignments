\section{Problem 1-2 Average Degree of a Growing Network}


Consider the following properties of the network at time t = T .

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the total number of nodes N?
	
	In each time step one node is added to the network. That is why $N = T$
	
	\item What is the total number of links L?
	
	For t=1 no links exist. For every node also a link is added. That is why $L = T - 1$
	
	\item What is the average degree <k>?
	
	The average degree is defined for an undirected graph as $<k> = \frac{2L}{N} $
	After inserting the values from above: $<k> = \frac{2*(T-1)}{T} = \frac{2T-2}{T} = T - \frac{2}{T} $
	
	\item What is the average degree in the limit T -> infinity?
	
	When inserting infinity in the formula above, the second term ($\frac{2}{T}$) becomes irrelevant. The remaining term $T$ is going to infinity. Consequently the average degree also goes to infinity.
