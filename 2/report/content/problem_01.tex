\section{Problem 2-1 Erdos-Renyi Network}

Consider an Erdos-Renyi network with N = 80 nodes, connected to each other with probability p = 0.05.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is (i) the expected number of links in the graph and (ii) the expected degree of a node?
	
	(i) The expected number of links in the graph:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\langle L \rangle = p \frac{N(N-1)}{2} = 0.05 \frac{80 \cdot (80 - 1)}{2} = 158
	\end{equation}
	
	The expected number of links in the graph is 158.
	
	(ii) The expected degree of a node:
	
	\begin{equation}
	\langle k \rangle = p(N-1) = 0.05 \cdot (80 -1) = 3.95
	\end{equation}
	
	The expected degree of a node in the network is 3.95.
	
	\item In which regime is the network?
	
	\item What is the probability to find exactly $L = 200$ links in the graph?
	
	\begin{equation}
	p_L = {{\frac{N(N-1)}{2}} \choose {L}} p^L (1-p)^{(N(N-1)/2)-L}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
	p_{200} = {{\frac{80(80-1)}{2}} \choose {200}} 0.05^{200} (1-0.05)^{(80(80-1)/2)-200} \approx 1.26e^{-4}
	\end{equation}
	
	The probability to find exactly 200 links in the graph is arround $1.26e^{-4}$.
	
	\item What is the probability that a node $i$ in the graph has degree $k_i = 5$ (using the binomial distribution)?
	
	\item Use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the model parameters $(N, p)$ for the shown graph.
