\section{Problem 2-1 Adjacency Matrix}

Consider an Erdos-Renyi network with N = 80 nodes, connected to each other with probability p = 0.05.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is (i) the expected number of links in the graph and (ii) the expected degree of a node?
	
	Undirected, because the adjacency matrix is symmetric.
	
	
	
\end{enumerate}
