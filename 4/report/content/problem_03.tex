\section{Problem 4-3 Network Measures of Real Graphs}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. The diameter of the largest connected component is 15.
\item 2. The node with the highest degree hast the ID 2332 and a degree of 1098.
\item 3.The number of triangles in the network is 3501542.
\item 4.The global clustering coefficient of the network is 0.22099367691190397.
\item 5.The power-law exponent of the degree distribution is 0.79...  which is wrong.  It should be arround 1.43
\item 6.  See the python notebook.
\end{itemize}
