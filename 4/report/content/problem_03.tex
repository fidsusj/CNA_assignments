See \textit{problem\_3.ipynb}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The diameter of the largest connected component is 15.
	\item The node with the highest degree hast the ID 2332 and a degree of 1098.
	\item The number of triangles in the network is 3501542.
	\item The global clustering coefficient of the network is approximately 0.15.
	\item The power-law exponent of the degree distribution is approximately 0.79...,  which is wrong.  It should be arround 1.43
	\item See the following figure:
